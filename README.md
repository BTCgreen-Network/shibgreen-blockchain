EARLY ADOPTERS GET MORE SHIBGREEN!!!!
The way SHIBgreen was designed was to get alot of coins farmed early on and then significantly drop very early on in the blockchains life cycle.
At height 168192 the block rewards will drop from 100,000 XSHIB to 20,000 XSHIB.
Early adopters get the privlage of getting a lot of coins :)
As of today (11/22/2021) each block of 100,000 XSHIB is selling for roughly 25cents on https://forks.green
Have fun everyone, and i wish everybody good luck in finding SHIBgreen blocks!
